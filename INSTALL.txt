KD Chart 2.x requires a Qt version >= 4 with XML support enabled.

================== UNIX ==========================
     
0) From the top directory of your KD Chart installation run the "configure" scripts.

   Use depending on the kind of build on one of the following;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug
     ./configure.sh -shared -release
     ./configure.sh -static -debug
     ./configure.sh -static -release

   To define the install-location use for example;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug -prefix /opt/kdchart


1) set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD Chart installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdchart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building KD Chart, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.


4) Build everything by typing:

make


5) (optionally:) Install KD Chart:

   From your top-level KD Chart directory just type

make install

   NOTE: Maybe admin rights are needed for installing it to /usr/local. Run "sudo make install", to install with admin rights.

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path: /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-VERSION/


6) (optionally:) Install the Qt Designer Plug-in:

a) automatic installation
   * Go to the plugins directory of your KD Chart installation.
   * Run "make distclean"
   * Run "qmake CONFIG+=install-qt"
   * Run "make install"

   This will copy the Plug-in into the QT plugin path,
   e.g. this might be $QTDIR/plugins/designer/

b) manual installation

   NOTE: This is only needed if you have skipped the top-level installation
         described above:

   Run "make install"
   from the plugins directory of your KD Chart installation.
   Make sure that your environment variable are set (see above) before doing so.

   This will copy the Plug-in into the lib/plugin/ directory of your installation path:
   /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-VERSION/lib/plugin

   From there you can copy it into your desired QT's version plugin path,
   e.g. this might be (your QT directory)/plugins/designer/,
   or you can set the QT_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable before running
   the designer.  If set, Qt will look for plugins in the paths
   (separated by the system path separator) specified in the variable.

7) Have a look at the examples applications it will get you started with KD Chart 2.x and its new API.


================ WINDOWS =======================

0) From the top directory of your KD Chart installation run the "configure" scripts.

    Use depending on the kind of build on one of the following;
     configure.bat -shared -debug
     configure.bat -shared -release
     configure.bat -static -debug
     configure.bat -static -release
     
    To define the install-location use for example;
     configure.bat -shared -debug -prefix c:/kdchart

1) Add the path to KD Chart lib into your LIB environment variable and the path 
to KD Chart bin into your PATH environment variable.

Or run:
set PATH=\path\to\kdchart\bin;%PATH%
set LIB=\path\to\kdchart\lib;%LIB%

2) Build everything by typing:

    nmake

3) (optionally:) Install KD Chart:

   From your top-level KD Chart directory just type
   
   nmake install
   
   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path: C:\KDAB\KDChart-VERSION\
   
4) (optionally:) Install the Qt Designer Plug-in:

a) automatic installation
   * Go to the plugins directory of your KD Chart installation.
   * Run "nmake distclean"
   * Run "qmake CONFIG+=install-qt"
   * Run "nmake install"

   This will copy the Plug-in into the QT plugin path,
   e.g. this might be $QTDIR/plugins/designer/
   
   NOTE: To make the plugin working it is needed to build kdchart
   with the exact same configuration designer was build with (what is usually
   "configure.bat -shared -release" if you installed the pre-compiled Qt
   provided by Nokia). Also it is needed to add your KD Chart installation
   directory to the PATH variable (e.g. set PATH=C:\KDAB\KDChart\lib;%PATH%).

b) manual installation

   NOTE: This is only needed if you have skipped the top-level installation
         described above:

   Run "nmake install"
   from the plugins directory of your KD Chart installation.
   Make sure that your environment variable are set (see above) before doing so.

   This will copy the Plug-in into the lib/plugin/ directory of your installation path:
   C:\KDAB\KDChart-VERSION\lib\plugin\

   From there you can copy it into your desired QT's version plugin path,
   e.g. this might be (your QT directory)/plugins/designer/,
   or you can set the QT_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable before running
   the designer.  If set, Qt will look for plugins in the paths
   (separated by the system path separator) specified in the variable.
