KD Chart 2.x requires a Qt version >= 4 with XML support enabled.

0) From the top directory of your KD Chart installation run the "configure" scripts.

   On Windows use depending on the kind of build on one of the following;
     configure.bat -shared -debug
     configure.bat -shared -release
     configure.bat -static -debug
     configure.bat -static -release

   On Unix use depending on the kind of build on one of the following;
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug
     ./configure.sh -shared -release
     ./configure.sh -static -debug
     ./configure.sh -static -release

   To define the install-location use for example;
     configure.bat -shared -debug -prefix c:/kdchart
     ./configure.sh -shared -debug -prefix /opt/kdchart


1) Unix

set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD Chart installation lib directory.

If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already then use this line:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdchart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The above has to be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course be run from a shell just before building KD Chart, but in this case your settings will only be available for this shell.

2) MacOS
Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead
of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3) Windows 
Add the path to KDChart lib into your LIB environment variable and the path 
to KDChart bin into your PATH environment variable.

Or run:
set PATH=\path\to\kdchart\bin;%PATH%
set LIB=\path\to\kdchart\lib;%LIB%


4) Build everything by typing:

make    # Unix,
nmake   # Windows


5) (optionally:) Install KD Chart:

   From your top-level KD Chart directory just type

make install   # Unix,
nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of
   your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-VERSION/
   For Windows that is: C:\KDAB\KDChart-VERSION\


6) (optionally:) Install the Qt Designer Plug-in:

a) automatic installation
   * Go to the plugins directory of your KDChart installation.
   * Run "make distclean" (Unix/Linux, Mac), or "nmake distclean" (Windows)
   * Run "qmake CONFIG+=install-qt"
   * Run "make install" (Unix/Linux, Mac), or "nmake install" (Windows)

   This will copy the Plug-in into the QT plugin path,
   e.g. this might be $QTDIR/plugins/designer/

b) manual installation

   NOTE: This is only needed if you have skipped the top-level installation
         described above:

   Run "make install" (Unix/Linux, Mac), or "nmake install" (Windows)
   from the plugins directory of your KDChart installation.
   Make sure that your environment variable are set (see above) before doing so.

   This will copy the Plug-in into the lib/plugin/ directory of your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-VERSION/lib/plugin
   For Windows that is: C:\KDAB\KDChart-VERSION\lib\plugin\

   From there you can copy it into your desired QT's version plugin path,
   e.g. this might be (your QT directory)/plugins/designer/,
   or you can set the QT_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable before running
   the designer.  If set, Qt will look for plugins in the paths
   (separated by the system path separator) specified in the variable.

7) Have a look at the examples applications it will get you started with KD Chart 2.x and its new API.
