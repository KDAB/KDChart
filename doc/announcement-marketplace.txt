KDAB Releases KD Chart 2.0 beta 1.

After almost a year of development time, KDAB is proud to be able to
present the first beta version of KD Chart 2.0, the next-generation
charting component for Qt 4. KD Chart 2.0 has been redesigned and
rewritten from the ground up so as to make optimal use of the new
possibilities in Qt 4. Some of the major new features and advantages
are:

- Full Interview support - plug any QAbstractTableModel into KD Chart
and have the data displayed.

- Full Arthur support - make use of the fantastic new rendering
possibilities in Qt 4.

- Separation of diagrams and coordinate planes, allows very simple
addition of custom chart types and axis scales.

Following the example of Qt 4, KD Chart features a completely
redesigned API that will be a stable basis for years to come.

Free evaluation packages and are available from
