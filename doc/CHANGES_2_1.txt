Changelog for KD Chart 2.1
==========================


A) The following is a short list of the most important new
   implementations and advancements in KD Chart 2.1,
   compared to the KD Chart 2.0.3 release:


0. Performance - the most important improvement
   --------------------------------------------
   The following diagram types have been considerably tuned
   by partially re-designing their implementation and by
   adding caching technics where appropriate, so these
   time-critical diagram types are substantially enhanced
   in several ways:
   * LineDiagram
   * BarDiagram


1. Installation
   ------------
   The advanced installer makes it easy to install KD Chart
   in your environment and make it ready to use.


2. New diagram types
   -----------------
   * Ternary diagrams
     The new group of classes around KDChart::AbstractTernaryDiagram
     (and TernaryAxis, TernaryGrid, ...) are providing a diagram
     type that had been frequently requested by our customers.
     see: examples/TernaryCharts/
   * Plotter
     The new diagram KDChart::Plotter can be added to cartesian
     coordinate planes and provides a way to plot multi-dimensional
     datasets.
     see: examples/Plotter/


3. User interface
   --------------
   * Data zooming per mouse is now provided through the new
     rubberbanding option
     AbstractCoordinatePlane::setRubberBandZoomingEnabled( bool )
     see examples/Zoom/ScrollBars/
   * Data item selection by mouse click is possible by the new
     reverse mapping feature:
     Clicks on an item (like a LineDiagram's point or a
     BarDiagram's bar) cause reverse mapping to indexes, enabeling
     the use of Qt's indexAt() function,
     see KDChart::AbstractDiagram::indexAt().


4. Drawing extra line markers
   --------------------------
   KD Chart 2.1 is providing the new classes
   ValueTracker / ValueTrackerAttributes and the new role
   ValueTrackerRole for drawing vertical and horizontal lines
   in a LineDiagram chart.


5. Axis, Grid, Coordinate Plane
   ----------------------------
   important new features:
   * CartesianAxis::setFixedDataCoordinateSpaceRelation( bool )
     allows for defining a fixed data-space / coordinate-space
     relation.
     This makes the coordinate plane increase its horizontal
     size as new data is added to the model - instead of shrinking
     the widths of the bars to make them all fit into the available
     width.
   * Reverse axes ( == decreasing values) are now available,
     see examples/Lines/Advanced/
   * Shared X axes may now be used even if the planes have
     different data ranges.

   important fixes:
   * Logarithmic drawing for CartesianAxis now working as planned.
   * Axis labels and texts are now re-positioned correctly
     on any layout/size changes, and they are no longer truncated
     at the grid limits, as it was happening in rare cases before.
   * Labels of the Y axis are drawn at the correct positions.
   * Sub-Tick marks for the X axis only drawn when appropriate.


6. Data Value Texts
   ----------------
   * QML data labels are possible now, this allows for much nicer
     labels by using the new option of specifying your own
     respective prefix and/or postfix strings.


7. Legend
   ------
   * Line style and marker type may now be indicated in the legend.
   * Legends may now be positioned as floating over the diagram,
     see examples/Legends/LegendOverDiagram/


8. Printing
   --------
   Several issues regarding printing have been resolved and the
   the calculation of relative sizes for KDChart's fonts on high
   resolution output has been adjusted accordingly.
