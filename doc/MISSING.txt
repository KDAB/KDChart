                 yet has been implemented for Ordinate axes only.
                 Abscissa axes will be supported by the next Beta,
                 for now a simple algorithm is used:
                 If there are too many labels on the Abscissa, it
                 will show item numbers from 10, 20, 30, ...
                 (or 100, 200, 300, ..., or ...), depending on the
                 total number of labels.

                 removed.

                 removed.
- Boxes:         Support for custom background in boxes has been
                 removed.
- Line charts    Ordinate scaling sometimes is broken in Percent

- Pie charts     Three-dimensional pie charts are not displayed
                 correctly.

                 provided by this release.
