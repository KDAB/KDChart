The following features have been removed from KD Chart 2.0 Beta 2
as they have not been sufficiently tested, or their implementation
is not complete.

[ Note: There will be at least Beta 3, and perhaps even one
        more Beta release, before the KD Chart 2.0 release. ]


- Documentation: There is no updated Programmer's Manual yet.
- Documentation: The API documentation is still incomplete.
- Documentation: More example programs will be provided in future
                 beta versions.
- Compatibility: There is no compatibility library for supporting KD
                 Chart 1.x code yet. This will be provided in a future
                 beta version.
- Chart types:   Ring charts are not included in this version.
- Chart types:   Hi-Lo charts are not included in this version.
- Chart types:   Box+Whisker charts are not included in this
                 version yet.
- Chart types:   3D pies are not included in this version, but 2D
                 pies are fully supported.
- Axes:          Only cartesian coordinate systems can be zoomed at
                 the moment, zooming polar coordinate systems is
                 still missing.
- Axes:          Automatic detection of best matching scale as of
                 yet has been implemented for Ordinate axes only.
                 Abscissa axes will be supported by the next Beta.
- Axes:          Support for logarithmic axes has been temporarily
                 removed.
- Axes:          Support for decreasing axes has been temporarily
                 removed.
- Bar diagrams   Three-dimensional look for bar diagrams is broken,
                 but we did NOT remove it from the released Beta code,
                 because there is a work-around for some of the cases:
                 wrong:  Top-most bar are higher than the data area.
                 work-around: Set the start/end of the Ordinate axis
                 manually, to a fixed value, to increase its size.
- Boxes:         Support for custom background in boxes has been
                 removed.
- Pie charts     Three-dimensional pie charts are not displayed
                 correctly.
- XML:           Saving chart configurations to XML has been
                 temporarily removed.
- Designer:      A Designer plugin is not yet provided.
