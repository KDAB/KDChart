0. Performance - the most important improvement
   --------------------------------------------
   The following diagram types have been considerably tuned
   by partially re-designing their implementation and by
   adding caching technics where appropriate, so these
   time-critical diagram types are substantially enhanced
   in several ways:
   * Line diagrams,
   * Bar Diagrams,


1. New diagram types
   -----------------
   * Horizontal/Lying Bar Graphes
   * Horizontal stacked bar diagrams
   * Levey Jennings diagrams


2. New features
   ----------------------------
   * Qt::ToolTipRole
      allows to define Tooltips
   * CartesianAxis::setAnnotations
      enables Axis positions to be annotated by some text
   * KDChart::CommentRole
      allows to define comments
   * Qt::SortOrder is now supported by kdchartlegend
   * its now possible to enable automated font shrinking for axis titles
