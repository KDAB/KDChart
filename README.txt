Introduction
============
KD Chart is a tool for creating business and scientific charts.
It provides developers with a sophisticated way to customize layouts
and to design and manage large numbers of axes.  Since all configuration
settings have practical defaults, you can usually get by with tweaking
just a few parameters and then relying on the defaults for the rest.

KD Chart targets C++ programmers who use Qt in their applications.
