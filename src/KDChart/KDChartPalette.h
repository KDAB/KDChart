   * \brief A Palette is a set of brushes (or colors) to be used
   * for painting data sets.
   *
   * The palette class encapsulates a colletion of brushes, which in
   * the simplest case are colors, to be used for painting a series of
   * data sets. When asked for the m-th color, a palette of size n will
   * wrap around and thus cycle through the available colors.
   *
   * Three builtin palettes are provided for convenience, one with a default
   * set of colors, one with a subdued color selection, one with rainbow
   * colors.
   *
   * When a palette changes, it emits a changed() signal. Hook up to it, if
   * you want to repaint when the color selection changes.
