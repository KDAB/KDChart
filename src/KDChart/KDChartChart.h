/*
Simplified(*) overview of object ownership in a chart:

                Chart is-a QWidget
                 |
          n CoordinatePlanes is-a AbstractArea is-a AbstractLayoutItem is-a QLayoutItem
                 |
            n Diagrams is-a QAbstractItemView is-a QWidget
              /   |   \
  AbstractGrid    |   Axes (can be shared between diagrams) is-a AbstractArea is-a... QLayoutItem
 (no base class)  |
                Legends is-a AbstractAreaWidget is-a QWidget

(*) less important classes, including base classes, removed.


Layout rules:

In principle, every size or existence change in one of the objects listed above must be propagated
to all other objects. This could change their size.
There are also settings changes that invalidate the size of other components, where the size changes
are detected and propagated.


Painting call tree (simplified):

Chart::paint() (from users) / paintEvent() (from framework)
ChartPrivate::paintAll()-----------------------------------------------\
CoordinatePlane::paintAll() (from AbstractArea)--------\               Axis::paintAll()-\
CoordinatePlane::paint() (from AbstractLayoutItem)     Grid::drawGrid()                 Axis::paint()
Diagram::paint( PaintContext* paintContext )

Note that grids are painted from the coordinate plane, not from the diagram as ownership would suggest.

     * @brief A chart with one or more diagrams.
     *
     * The Chart class represents a drawing consisting of one or more diagrams
     * and various optional elements such as legends, axes, text boxes, headers
     * or footers. It takes ownership of all these elements when they are assigned
     * to it. Each diagram is associated with a coordinate plane, of which the chart
     * can have more than one. The coordinate planes (and thus the associated diagrams)
     * can be laid out in various ways.
     *
     * The Chart class makes heavy use of the Qt Interview framework for model/view
     * programming, and thus requires data to be presented to it in a QAbstractItemModel
     * compatible way. For many simple charts, especially if the visualized data is
     * static, KDChart::Widget provides an abstracted interface, that hides the complexity
     * of Interview to a large extent.
