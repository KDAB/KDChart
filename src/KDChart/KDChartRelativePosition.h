  \brief Defines relative position information: reference area, position
  in this area (reference position), horizontal / vertical padding, and rotating.

  See detailed description of \a KDChart::Position for an illustration of the
  different possible reference positions.

  Using RelativePosition you can specify the relative parts
  of some position information, and you can specify the absolute parts:
  the reference area, and the position in this area.

  \note To get an absolute position, you have three options:
  \li either you declare both, the relative and the absolute parts,
  using setReferenceArea for the later,
  \li or you specify a set of points, using setReferencePoints,
  \li or you refrein from using either, but leave it to KD Chart to find
  a matching reference area for you.
