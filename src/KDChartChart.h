     * @brief A chart with one or more diagrams.
     *
     * The Chart class represents a drawing consisting of one or more diagrams
     * and various optional elements such as legends, axes, text boxes, headers
     * or footers. It takes ownership of all these elements when they are assigned
     * to it. Each diagram is associated with a coordinate plane, of which the chart
     * can have more than one. The coordinate planes (and thus the associated diagrams)
     * can be layed out in various ways.
     *
     * The Chart class makes heavy use of the Qt Interview framework for model/view
     * programming, and thus requires data to be presented to it in a QAbstractItemModel
     * compatible way. For many simple charts, especially if the visualized data is
     * static, KDChart::Widget provides an abstracted interface, that hides the complexity
     * of Interview to a large extent.
