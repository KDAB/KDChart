These are the instructions for installing KD Chart using the CMake buildsystem.
CMake version 3.1.0 or higher is required.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

KD Chart 2.5.0 supports Qt version 4.x.
KD Chart 2.5.1 to 2.7.x supports both Qt 4 and Qt 5.
KD Chart 2.8.x supports Qt5 only.

The installation directory defaults to c:\KDAB\KDChart-<version> on Windows
and /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-<version> on non-Windows.  You can change this
location by passing the option -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

1) From the top directory of your KD Chart installation create a build directory:

     mkdir build

   and change directory into that build directory:

     cd build

2) Now run 'cmake' depending on the kind of build one of the following:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
     cmake -DKDChart_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
     cmake -DKDChart_STATIC=True -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

   To define the install-location use for example:
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/kdchart ..
     cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kdchart ..

3) Unix

   set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to your KD Chart installation lib directory.

   If you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set already, then in your terminal run:
    % LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/kdchart/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    % export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   The above must be added into your .bashrc or similar to remain. It may also of course
   be run from a shell just before building software using KD Reports, but in this case
   your settings will only be available for this shell.

4) MacOS

   Proceed as described above, but using DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5) Windows

   For running executables, add the path to the KD Chart dll (kdchart\bin) into your PATH.
   eg. set PATH=\path\to\kdchart\bin;%PATH%

   For development, add the path to the KD Chart lib (kdchart\lib) into your LIB environment.
   eg. set LIB=\path\to\kdchart\lib;%LIB%

6) Build everything by typing:

   From your top-level KD Chart directory run:

   % make    # Unix, Mac
   % nmake   # Windows

7) (optionally:) Install KD Chart:

   From your top-level KD Reports directory run:

   % make install   # Unix, Mac
   % nmake install  # Windows

   This will copy the necessary files into the sub-directories of your installation path:
   For Unix/Linux, Mac: /usr/local/KDAB/KDChart-VERSION/
   For Windows this is: C:\KDAB\KDChart-VERSION\

8) Have a look at the examples applications. They will get you started with KD Chart.

== Testing ==
To build the testing harness, pass -DKDChart_TESTS=true to CMake, like so:
  % cmake -DKDChart_TESTS=true

Then run 'make test' to run the unit tests.

== Using ==
From your CMake project, add

    find_package(KDChart CONFIG REQUIRED)

and link to the imported target KDChart::kdchart.
That's all you need to do (the imported target also brings in the include directories)

You may also need to point the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable depending
on where you installed KDChart.
