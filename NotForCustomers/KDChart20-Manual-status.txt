That is a short status about where we are when it comes to the programer manual

You can also visualize its last state by opening the kdchart.pdf file 
in this repository.


Table of content will need to be restructured when the manual is completed.



It is especially important to review the sample code and screen shots presented(most of it will probably need to be replaced).This is true for all sections and sub-sections atm.

I would need help on every point below at the moment.

Chapter 5 Customizing your Chart Needs to be done

Colors = 0% done 
Fonts = 0% done
Markers = 0% done
ThreeD = 0% done 
Tips = 0% done

Chapter 6 Headers and Footers

How to configure = 0% done
Tips = 0% done

Chapter 7 Legends

How to configure = 0% done
Tips = 0% done

Chapter 8 Axes 

How to configure = 0% done

Chapter 9 Advanced Charting 
Here the idea was to have a bit of  introduction text with some commented code sample and a complete example (with screen-shot) for each section 


Frame and Background = 0 % done
DataValue Manipulation = 0 % done
Axis Manipulation = 0 % done 
Grid Manipulation = 0 % done 
Interactive Chart = 0 % done
Multiple Chart = 0 % done
Zooming = 0 % done
