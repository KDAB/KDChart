KDChart expects a certain format of the model data to be able to display it's
diagrams: It expects data series to be stored in the columns, and the
individual data points in the rows of the model. This approach matches those
of other 3rd party tools that may serve as data providers, such as GNUPlot or
spreadsheets. 

A diagram will always display all data it finds in the model. To select a
certain set of columns, DatasetProxyModel (in <KDChartDatasetProxyModel>) can
be used. 

In some cases, a more complicated model already in use by the customer may not
allow to simply select columns for the display data. In this example, the
customer used a model in which the row values alternated between column zero
and column one. In such a case, it will be necessary to use a proxy model to
transform the customers model into the format required by KDChart. This
example shows a rather simple and straightforward way to implement such a
proxy model.
