- CoordinatePlane also needs to translate with perspective (x, y, and z
  coordinates)
- CoordinatePlane also needs to translate distances from diagram to screen
  space (double to pixel)
- it should be simple to make the coordinate plane only display the upper
  right quadrant, possibly with 3D decorations like in the example (used in
  most diagrams, I guess)
- 3D diagrams look good if they are drawn without isometric distortion,
  otherwise they quickly look ugly
- 2D and 3D diagrams of the same logical type (bar diagrams, line diagrams)
  should possibly be done as different diagram types that share private helper
  functions, or use separate drawing delegates for the same type (separate
  drawing delegates for objects like bars seem to be a better solution, as it
  allows for mixed 2D/3D diagrams, as Till pointed out)
- dataBoundaries is called in all different places, and seems to be very
  expensive (it iterates over the whole model and visits all items, so that
  can be expected). The example implementation here holds a ModelDataCache
  class that reduces the number of data() calls into the model drastically. I
  hope this can be factored out for all diagrams.
