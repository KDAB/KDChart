- CoordinatePlane also needs to translate with perspective (x, y, and z
  coordinates)
- CoordinatePlane also needs to translate distances from diagram to screen
  space (double to pixel)
- it should be simple to make the coordinate plane only display the upper
  right quadrant, possibly with 3D decorations like in the example (used in
  most diagrams, I guess)
