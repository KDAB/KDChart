The attributes sets section says that getters are only per cell, which is not 
true anymore, I think. I'd still keep the fallback mechanism explanation there and suggest using per-cell getters, in general.
There are now per-column and per-model getters too.
I would write that we encourage use of per-cell, since then the fallbacks 
work, as you are already explaining.

Secondly, I think you have implicit and explicit confused, semantically.
Explicit is when it is actually, factually there, implicit is when it has to 
be guessed from the context.
I found two or three places where you refer to an "implicit parameter", for 
example.
Which makes me think you mean explicit.

And the final thing is really more a _khz question. There's this very strange 
thing about avoiding compiler warnings about not freed memory by static 
casting a return value.
I think khz introduced that in the API overview.
BarDiagram *bars =
     static_cast<BarDiagram *>(myChart->replaceDiagram( new BarDiagram ));
That makes no sense at all.
And it's ugly.
Let's ask khz if there is a reasoning behind this. Maybe it has a point we 
fail to grasp.

Multiple axes and axes sharing and such I found missing, but I guess that's advanced stuff?
